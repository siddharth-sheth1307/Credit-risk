# Credit risk modelling
 Credit score cards are a common risk control method in the financial industry. It makes use of personal information and data submitted by credit card applicants to predict the probability of future defaults and credit card borrowings. Using this the bank is able to decide whether to issue a credit card to the applicant. The goal is to classify whether the applicant is a “good” or “bad” client using Logistic regression and build scorecards to assist in this matter
Another important aspect is model interpretribility to understand why the model predicted what it predicted and what features influence them the most. 
I utilised SHAP values for this to under Global and Local interpretability. Global interpretability helped understand the features that most affect the target variable(Positive/Negative) overall in the model. 
Local interpretability helps granularly identify per entry as to why it made those predictions and what features drove them towards it.
